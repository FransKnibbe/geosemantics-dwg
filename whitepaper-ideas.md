# Ideas for a white paper 

At the most recent GeoSematics DWG, September 2019 in Banff, there was a discussion about newly submitted change requests for GeoSPARQL. In order to create momentum and interest for a GeoSPARQL 2.0 working group with active members, some more marketing is needed. The proposal at the DWG was to do this in the form of a white paper. 

The white paper should show that there is indeed practical value in graph data representation and linked data with strong(er) semantics. 

## How to contribute
Users and implementers are very much invited to collaborate on this white paper! First, let's gather some ideas on what to put into the paper. Add some content either to this page (i.e ideas for topics, questions, text snippets you already have laying around), or to a new page in this repository. Or start a discussion by creating an [issue](https://github.com/opengeospatial/geosemantics-dwg/issues). We will setup the structure of the white paper and start filling it properly as a later step. 

## Topics
(examples)
- Business reasons for linked data / knowledge graphs
- Identified user communities of linked geo data
- Real world examples / success stories of linked geo data
- Geospatial support in triple stores, including treatments of level of GeoSPARQL support, and things GeoSPARQL is lacking
- Overview and discussion of GeoSPARQL change requests

## Questions to treat in the white paper
(examples)

Could some form of GeoSPARQL become as widely adopted as SF-SQL or really become a key element of the linked data Web? Would coordination with GraphQL be a good idea? Should GeoSPARQL move towards an ontology of space positions, regions, and relations, rather than being rooted in the General Feature Model?

## Why OGC should update GeoSPARQL
(example text snippet; source: Frans Knibbe)

Linked Data and, by extension, GeoSPARQL is not widely used by OGC members (or the geospatial domain).

Indeed the more one is involved with geospatial data only, the less need there is to use GeoSPARQL. I have worked with people from the geospatial domain and people that primarily work with Linked Data or the semantic web. Of the first group, few people had even heard of GeoSPARQL. But I would like to argue that if the OGC chooses to improve GeoSPARQL, it should be done just because parties on the fringes of the geospatial domain depend on it, and do use it. At the moment, GeoSPARQL is the only more or less stable and standardised way of using geographical data on the web. So people use it, whether it is good or not. I think the OGC has an obligation towards the many people that do work with geospatial data, but have a core business outside of that domain. 

For example, developers of data storage systems (SQL databases, triple stores, â€¦.) need GeoSPARQL for data types and functions. API developers need to mirror standard functionality  Web developers need to make data insightful to uses. Data publishers need to make difficult modelling decisions. Data modellers outside of the geospatial domain may have to deal with bits of geospatial information in their models. I would like to speak out for these (and other) groups of people who may not have had sufficient voice in making the decision to update GeoSPARQL or not.
