This is the open repository for work done within the OGC GeoSemantics DWG. 

Currently we are gathering [change requests for GeoSPARQL 2.0](http://ogc.standardstracker.org/requestlist.cgi?quicksearch=geosparql) and working on a [white paper](whitepaper-ideas.md) explaining the business reasons, and requirements, for a geographical query language for graphs as well as an accompanying ontology.
